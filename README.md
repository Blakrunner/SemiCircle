# SemiCircle
Creating a semi circle using SFML

I created this file as I couldn't find anything easy to use with SFML.
The SemiCircle works with SFML and uses all Transforms.

The SemiCircle can be used with default settings to draw a semi circle,
or you can use as follows:

SemiCircle semiCircle(sf::Vector2f(size x radius, size y radius), start point, end point)
